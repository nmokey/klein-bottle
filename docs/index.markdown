This site is part of my final project for the first semester of Mrs. Reyes's multivariable calculus course! It's hosted by GitHub Pages at [this repository](https://github.com/nmokey/klein-bottle){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  

For my project, I'm focusing on exploring a specific subset of topological spaces called **non-orientable manifolds**, their definitions and fascinating properties, and their connection to multivariable calculus.

To understand *non-orientable manifolds*, we can break it into two pieces: defining orientability and defining manifolds. 

In topology, a **manifold** is a topological space which that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. Suraces are simply 2-dimensional manifolds, so when we talk about non-orientable surfaces for all intents and purposes they're basically the same thing.  

There are a couple ways to think of **orientability**: the formal definition is that it's a property of topological manifolds which permits a consistent sense of clockwise and counterclockwise. If you choose a direction of a normal vector and keep assigning normals along the surface, when you loop back around to your starting point the normal vector should still point in the same direction. 

In popular mathematics, a surface that's **non-orientable** is usually descirbed as having onlly one side, partially because that's the most exciting way to put it.

## möbius strip
Named after August Ferdinand Möbius.
## klein bottle
Named after Felix Klein.  
It's important to note that klein bottles are 4d manifolds immersed in 3d space so we can visualize them: in their "true form," they have no self-intersection. This is where the multivariable calculus comes in: we can use level surfaces to project them into 3d space and try to get a glimpse of what Klein Bottles *should* look like.  

Let's list some amusing, fascinating facts about them:
- only one side
- zero volume (perfect for alcohol)
- actually 4d manifolds

There are certain topics that are so intrinsically fascinating that you can’t rest until you find out more. The only way I can describe it is the sort of feeling that you get when you learn for the first time that a Mobius strip - or in my case, a Klein bottle - is nonorientable, essentially meaning that it has only one side (a pretty high level explanation). You sort of think to yourself well, that doesn’t sound right. You look at one and start tracing it in the air with your finger, slowly realizing *holy crap, this thing actually does only have one side… how? why?* I think that this sense of awe is universal and everyone has their own topics that elicit that feeling. For me, Klein bottles and the whole concept of non-orientability have been a continuous fascination for me. so I’m excited for the opportunity to share why I think it’s interesting. Nonorientable surfaces in particular are relatively far from applied math, and so my why for choosing to explore them in further depth does not lie in any sort of external use but rather that intrinsic curiosity.
